The known issues:

1. In Linux version, there is no 32-bit. It is in proccess.

2. In Linux, GWindow fullscreen is not covering the whole screen. On certain distros.

3. On Mac, OpenGLSurface windows do not have a title bar.

4. On Mac, you must minimize then maximize after resizing a window. (This may already be fixed...)

Fixed in update 4a:

5. *FALSE ALARM* On Windows, The GDirectX11Surface cannot be attatched to a closed window.

6. *FIXED* On Windows, The GDirectX11Surface must not be accessed after a DESTROY window event is processed.

7. *FIXED* On Windows, The GDirectX11Surface leaks memory if you resize the screen or request Z Buffer support.
