Then you should probably upgrade...

Seriously though... just make an empty console App and drop in the two source files along with the Gateware folder.
It should work just fine. (Be sure the directory structure is the same)

If the libraries give you trouble just switch to the DLLs or just compile the source directly.
You can even pull the GxxxCreate() (non-mangled) functions straight out of an DLL explicitly if you are feeling feisty.

On Windows you can use "LoadLibrary" followed by "GetProcAddress", this method will be different on other platforms.
