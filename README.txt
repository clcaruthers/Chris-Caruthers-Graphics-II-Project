-Island Theme
-The Render to Texture is the palm tree scene/painting on the easel.
-Water has specular reflections
-The spot light is off by default because I think it looks better that way, but it can be toggled on
-The program will take a good 20+ seconds to load because I'm using a very high poly water model. If you don't care how good it looks you can switch it to the low poly model by changing the #define at the top of LetsDrawSomeStuff to OCEAN_LP
